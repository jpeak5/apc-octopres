\projectname, a digital humanities project centered around the literary culture of the 1840s in America, seeks to accumulate and present digital artifacts that re-contextualize this period in history for modern readers and researchers. The project team is composed of a cross-disciplinary mix of scholars and students committed to establishing a research archive for the equally diverse audience of scholarly researchers, students and the general public. At its broadest, the scope of the project includes all American Antebellum authors and would take shape as part of a consortium of linked archives. As a first step, the project will focus on Poe's involvement with four periodicals, the \bwj, \slm, \bgm and \gm. The work to be accomplished in a first phase includes scanning each page, extracting the text via OCR, and storing these materials as archival records in a sustainable archive for future research and next phases of the project. 

This initial phase will establish a trusted digital repository (TDR) that will serve as the basis for research. Facilities for research will include, at a minimum, document retrieval and full-text search. With these basic foundation blocks firmly laid, other services can be built that further enhance the value of this resource for research including scholarly annotation, use of RDF for making semantic inferences, and a range of client web services that expose the archive to other repositories and applications.
