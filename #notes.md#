## perspective ##
* the design of such systems requires careful communication of end goals between IT and Archives experts; balancing them with the designated community



### Preservation Action ###

#### Secure Storage ####

#### Clean and Validate ####
* also, maintain the original, intact
#### Data Structure ####
* ultra-stable formats
    * ASCII/UNICODE, XML

#### Methods ####
* Emulation
* Migration, Normalization
    * normalization formats should be ultra-stable, sound, well-known
    * Migration will be required in time, but will be eased by our previous use of standard formats
        * this will incur cost as the requirement to document the migration careful is key to maintaining the integrity of the record
* Encapsulation might be accomplished by XENA or kopLibRi (makes AIPs too!)
