Poe is famous for his tales and poetry, indeed, every grade school child has been thrilled by <I>The Raven</I>, for instance. It is probably less well-known that in his capacity as an editor of several periodicals, he took the opportunity to offer commentary on the events and cultural themes that mark the American Antebellum period. The Poe's Magazine Worldproject will draw attention to this aspect of the author and his perspective by creating a digital collection of four of the periodicals in which he played a key editorial role: <I>Burton's Gentleman's Magazine</I>, <I>The Broadway Journal</I>, <I>Graham's Magazine</I>, and the <I>Southern Literary Messenger</I>. This phase of the project will focus on Poe's involvement with these periodicals and will render each page as scanned image with fully searchable text.
