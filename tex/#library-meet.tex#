\subsection{Pree-people process}
costs, personnel, machinery
chris:  how much is the library willing to participate
elayne: what have we considered already?
chris: 4 journals, 3200 pages
reproduce the experience of the original
Gina: contentDM
-55 pages per hour, 4200 pages is nothing
Lauren: nuts and bolts: project librarian?
-elayne: recommend hire a project librarian; but they need to be good; a dedicated person-engine
--person liek this is \$45-50k+
--thta person should in some way be attached to the library; 
--library gives a per-page price as a sub-contractor
--dirty OCR + scans
GINA: the subcontractor cost per page @3800 pages, would take a month of student labor; \$1 per page, file organization, scan, library keeps TIFF in perpetuity;
-process would take about a month
elayne: all but one issue of Southern Lit Messenger is available at Mississippi; open question whether it comes here or gets scanned there
-OCR cleanup is somewhat easy with Poe since clean copy exists (eapoe.org)


need to show what is possible
