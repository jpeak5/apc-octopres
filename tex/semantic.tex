\subsection{Semantic web}
Further, in an increasingly interconnected and socially interlinked world, the digital archive assumes a certain burden to provide its content to patrons (researchers, students, the public) in increasingly compelling ways. One of the most promising technologies for achieving this end is embodied in the concept of the Semantic Web \needcite[TBL]. The semantic web represents an inductive step beyond the character of the web we've grown to know in the last several decades. In this new web, hyperlinks are not merely a means by which to refer to some other, arbitrary, web resource, rather, the reference itself is imbued with an additional dimension that describes the nature of the relationship between the thing and what it points to. \needcite[Barthes?] Employing such technology in an archives setting improves discoverability by expanding the role of the archive from simple document retrieval to something much richer.
