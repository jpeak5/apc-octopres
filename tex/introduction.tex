\projectname, a digital humanities project centered around the literary culture of the 1840s in America, seeks to accumulate and present digital artifacts that re-contextualize this period in history for future readers, students and researchers. The project team is composed of a cross-disciplinary mix of scholars and students committed to establishing a research archive for the equally diverse audience of scholarly researchers, students and the general public. At its broadest, the scope of the project includes all American Antebellum authors and would take shape as part of a consortium of linked archives. As a first step, however, the project will focus on Poe's involvement with four periodicals, the \bwj, \slm, \bgm and \gm.
