\subsubsection{Repository Software}
Software packages and cloud services exist that provide some or all of the functions required of a digital repository. Off the shelf, a number of candidates present themselves. Fedora, DSpace, DAITSS and ContentDM are the most prominent. Because ContentDM is a closed-source product, we will not consider it a viable option.

The Flexible Extensible Digital Object Repository Architecture (Fedora) is a backend system that manages ingest, content, and policies.
