The \apc project has been underway for a few years, and in that time, there has been much discussion and converging general agreement over exactly what the content of the repository should be and how to best present it. In the last year, the project has focused its efforts around presenting a proof-of-concept prototype exploring three Poe tales. From a technical perspective, this has been achieved through adoption and customization of the Omeka web publishing platform. More will be said about Omeka later on, but for now, suffice it to say that the Omeka prototyping effort has exposed important requirements of the project, specifically, needs for:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item{a user-friendly management interface to the repository}
  \item{flexible content presentation options}
  \item{fine-grained metadata schemes}
  \item{semantic relationships between entities, especially at the sub-document level}
\end{enumerate}
