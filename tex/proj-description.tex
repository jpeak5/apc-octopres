The domain of this project is hierarchical, and at its most general, it includes everything that can be defined as \emph{\apc}. As a first step, the group will focus on one segment of one author's work. Entitled \projectname, the initial Recognizing that small steps begin a great journey, the work of the project will begin with a careful focus on the work of Edgar Allen Poe. 

\subsection{Domain}
Poe is famous for his tales and poetry, indeed, every grade school child has been thrilled by \emph{The Raven}, for instance. It is probably less well-known that in his capacity as an editor of several periodicals, he took the opportunity to offer commentary on the events and cultural themes that mark the American Antebellum period. The \projectname project will draw attention to this aspect of the author and his perspective by creating a digital collection of four of the periodicals in which he played a key editorial role: \maglist. This phase of the project will focus on Poe's involvement with these periodicals and will render each page as scanned image with fully searchable text.

\subsection{Goals}
As with any project, finding balance between the conceivable and the possible is essential to success. This team has chosen an incremental approach to its larger goals, and we will differentiate first steps from larger outcomes with the notions of \emph{core} versus \emph{stretch}.
