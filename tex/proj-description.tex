Understanding the project domain, background, goals and roadmap are essential to asserting the way forward. The domain of the project is hierarchical, and at its most general, it includes everything that can be defined as \emph{\apc}. Recognizing that small steps begin a great journey, the APC group have wisely decided to begin with a narrower scope, specifically, the writings of Edgar Allen Poe. As the first step, they have chosen to focus on his work as editor of periodicals. That effort is the subject of this discussion.

\subsection{Domain}
Poe is famous for his tales and poetry, indeed, every grade school child has been thrilled by \emph{The Raven}, for instance. It is probably less well-known that in his capacity as an editor of several periodicals, he took the opportunity to offer commentary on the events and cultural themes that mark the American Antebellum period. The \projectname project will draw attention to this aspect of the author and his perspective by creating a digital collection of four of the periodicals in which he played a key editorial role: \maglist.
