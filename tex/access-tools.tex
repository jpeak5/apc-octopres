In addition to building custom portals and visualizations based on the content of the repository, a number of ready-made applications exist to present the repository to end-users. A number of web front-ends have been written and published for Fedora\cite{fedora-frontends}. For example, the Scholar's Lab has published their Fedora Connector for Omeka, which lets Omeka users populate exhibits and collections from the content of the Fedora repository. It does not, like Islandora, offer repository management functionality\cite{fedora-connector}.
