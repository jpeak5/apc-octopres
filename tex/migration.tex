To date, a great deal of content has been located in collections, scanned and stored in the Omeka repository. Because Omeka is open source, developing a migration path for existing records will require careful execution, but little difficulty or uncertainty. Further, there is no technical or economic reason that this will need to be done in haste, as may be the case in a hosted environment where each megabyte incurs a certain cost per hosted minute. 
\subsection{Transition}
Once an alternative platform is chosen, selected and thoroughly tested, the Omeka site can be put into a read-only state such that no further modifications to its records database can occur. With the database frozen, a full database backup, using mysqldump, will create a fixed-point snapshot of the database state, a restoration point.
\subsection{Translation}
Using knowledge gained in the course of developing custom Omeka plugins, data translation scripts will marshal complete records from the Omeka database tables and render each as a SIP ingestible by the new system. With all of its records safely ingested in the new system, the old system will remain in read-only state as a reference for as long as the team deems useful (probably a year).
