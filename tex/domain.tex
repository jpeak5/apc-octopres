  \item[Scan]{Each of the 4,000 pages contained in the corpus in scope will be scanned to high resolution TIFF}
  \item[Extract]{OCR and minimal human processing will result in level 2 TEI\cite{tei_sig_on_libraries_best_2011} markup for each page}
  \item[Preserve]{These artifacts must be preserved in a trusted system}
\end{description}

As a result of these three tasks, the initial phase will establish a trusted digital repository (TDR) suitable as a research resource. Facilities for research will include, at a minimum, document retrieval and full-text search. With these basic foundation blocks firmly laid, other services can be built that further enhance the value of this resource for research including scholarly annotation, use of RDF for making semantic inferences, and a range of client web services that expose the archive to other repositories and applications.
