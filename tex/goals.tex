\subsubsection{Core}
Immediate project goals include digitizing each page of every periodical volume of which Poe took part. Considering only the years in which he was actively employed by these editorials, the corpus contains just less than 4,000 pages. The primary deliverable for the next stage of this project will be a permanent, web-accessible repository of a scan for each page and fully searchable text. The tasks, explored below, required to achieve core goals include scanning, text extraction, curation, and preservation. Facilities for research will include, at a minimum, document retrieval and full-text search. 

\subsubsection{Stretch}
With core foundation blocks firmly laid, other services may be built that further enhance the value of this resource for research including scholarly annotation, semantic curation, and a range of APIs that expose the archive to other repositories and applications as Linked Open Data. Annotation will consist of moderated scholarly annotations made by local and distributed domain experts.  Semantic curation entails the identification and markup of the occurence of significant entities within the text, including people, places, corporate bodies. Client APIs will be developed and exposed to allow others to reuse the archived dataset for their own, as yet unimagined, purposes. In light of the current trend in archives towards Linked Open Data (LOD) and the aspirations of the project team, it is reasonable to consider the APC project well positioned to be one of the next notable contributors to this burgeoning community of archives.
