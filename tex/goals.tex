\subsection{Core Goals and Requirements}
For the editions of the magazines that Poe edited, the page count is about 4,000. The primary project goal is the establishment of a digital repository containing the text and scanned image of each of these pages. In addition to making each page image available,the text should be fully searchable. Providing access to page images and text search tools implies an access-controlled, web-based interface. Maintaing the integrity of complex, mixed-media, multipage document records requires sturdy archival frameworks and flexible metadata standards. 


\subsection{Stretch}
With core foundation blocks laid, the team will build up enhanced access services, including annotation, semantic search, and the infrastructure to expose the repository as linked open data. 
\begin{description}
  \item[Annotation] consists of moderated user annotations to the elements of the repository. These annotations may become part of the archival record.   
  \item[Search] entails semantic markup. The team will identify or develop an appropriate ontology with which to describe semantic relationships amongst repository elements at the sub-document level. Initial candidates for such markup include people, places, corporate bodies captured with EAC-CPF. 
  \item[Linked Open Data] Client webservices will be developed  to allow others to reuse the archive as a dataset for their own purposes.
